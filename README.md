# simGeorge: background and license

This repository hosts code/settings for creating a GPT-2 inflected language model that writes catalogue descriptions in the "voice" of [Mary Dorothy George](https://doi.org/10.1093/ref:odnb/45657).

These code/settings can be run via Max Woolf's [Colaboratory Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1VLG8e7YSEwypxU-noRNhsv5dW4NfTGce) (see '[How To Make Custom AI-Generated Text With GPT-2](https://minimaxir.com/2019/09/howto-gpt2/)'), or a local install of the python package [gpt-2-simple](https://github.com/minimaxir/gpt-2-simple) (though the latter hasn't been tested).

The dataset used is `CurV-corpus-27Jan2019.txt` at [http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3245037](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3245037).

This work is based on data created during the project '[Curatorial Voice: legacy descriptions of art objects and their contemporary uses](https://curatorialvoice.github.io/)', and is associated with the project '[Legacies of Catalogue Descriptions and Curatorial Voice: Opportunities for Digital Scholarship](https://cataloguelegacies.github.io/)'.

Two datasets and two papers have emerged from this work:

- Andrew Salway and James Baker, ‘Investigating Curatorial Voice with Corpus Linguistic Techniques: the case of Dorothy George and applications in museological practice’, Museum & Society ([2020](http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/id/eprint/89738/)).

All data are derived from text written by M. Dorothy George and published between 1935 and 1954 as volumes 5 to 11 of the *[Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires Preserved in the Department of Prints and Drawings in the British Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalogue_of_Political_and_Personal_Satires_Preserved_in_the_Department_of_Prints_and_Drawings_in_the_British_Museum)*.
