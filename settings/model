If you're retraining a model on new text, you need to download the GPT-2 model first.

There are three released sizes of GPT-2:

124M (default): the "small" model, 500MB on disk.
355M: the "medium" model, 1.5GB on disk.
774M: the "large" model, cannot currently be finetuned with Colaboratory but can be used to generate text from the pretrained model (see later in Notebook)
1558M: the "extra large", true model. Will not work if a K80 GPU is attached to the notebook. (like 774M, it cannot be finetuned).


`gpt2.download_gpt2(model_name="124M")

# this gives more weighting to MDG language, as her voice is overwhelmed when using the bigger models.
